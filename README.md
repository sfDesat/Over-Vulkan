# Over Vulkan
Over Vulkan uses a rendering mod called VulkanMod giving it **better performance** than Sodium. Normal Minecraft uses OpenGL for rendering. Vulkan is a different way of rendering a game, with way higher performance. Expect an improvement of **4-5x** the fps compared to vanilla.

### Compatibility
Because this pack uses a different way of rendering, Vulkan, some mods wont be compatible. Mainly mods that adjust major visuals like Distant Horizons. Here is a [list](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod/wiki/Incompatible-mods) (note: this list is a bit outdated).

### Gameplay
No significant changes are made to the gameplay, because this pack is designed to be a foundation for your own pack. You can add your own gameplay. 

### Requirements
To speed up chunk generation and general performance, a minimum of **2500-3500 Mb** allocated memory is recommended. This is dependend on your render distance so playing with lower render distance allows a lower amount of allocated memory.  
_Installed Modpack > Settings > Java and memory > Memory allocated._
